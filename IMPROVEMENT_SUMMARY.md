# Sin Wave Prediction AI - Performance Improvement Summary

## Original Performance Issues
- **Correlation coefficient**: -0.17 (extremely poor)
- **RÂ²**: -2.1 (negative, indicating worse than baseline)
- **Normalized RMSE**: 40% (very high error rate)
- **Assessment**: Completely inadequate for practical use

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Insufficient model complexity**: Simple 3-layer MLP was inadequate for time series patterns
2. **Poor architecture design**: No attention to temporal relationships
3. **Suboptimal parameters**: Low learning rate, insufficient training epochs
4. **Narrow input context**: Only 10 time steps of history
5. **No normalization**: Raw data training without proper scaling
6. **No regularization**: Risk of overfitting without dropout/batch norm

## Implemented Improvements

### 1. Advanced Model Architecture
- **Bidirectional LSTM**: Captures patterns from both past and future contexts
- **Convolutional layers**: Extract local temporal features
- **Residual connections**: Enable deeper learning and gradient flow
- **Multi-layer design**: More expressive capacity

### 2. Enhanced Data Processing
- **Extended context**: Increased input size from 10 to 20 time steps
- **Batch normalization**: Stable training with normalized inputs
- **Better data loading**: Improved sequence generation

### 3. Optimized Training
- **Better learning rate**: 0.001 instead of default
- **Early stopping**: Prevents overfitting with patience mechanism
- **Longer training**: Up to 200 epochs with early termination
- **Larger batch size**: 64 for more stable gradients

### 4. Regularization Techniques
- **Dropout**: 0.1 rate to prevent overfitting
- **Batch normalization**: Throughout the network
- **L2 regularization**: Through proper weight initialization
